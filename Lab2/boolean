#notes from Mr. German's end of lab nano session
boolean

the boolean type: true, false
1 < 2

Operators for boolean type: not, and, or
a       b       not and         a or b
---------------------------------------

Please simplify the following expression:
not a

a == True
a == False
a and (not a)
a or (not a)    true

Last one is like simplify 1 * n which is n
                          0 * n          0
                          2n - n - n     0
